1,.357 Magnum revolver,3,1, 2, 110,"The .357 Magnum revolver is a single action, fixed-cylinder revolver that fires .357 Magnum and .38 special rounds. It has an average firing rate but makes up for it with a somewhat more powerful damage output. Its fixed cylinder is reloaded by hand one round at a time through the loading gate, as such it can be interrupted mid-way through reloading and fired if needed. "
2,Lucky,3,1, 2.5, 1500,"Lucky is a unique version of the standard .357 Magnum revolver. It deals moderate damage and has a high fire-rate and Critical Chance and uses a low amount of Action Points. The barrel, frame and cylinder are made of a smooth black metal decorated with ornate gold etchings, and the polished ivory handle is inlaid with the clubs symbol. The word ""Lucky"" is engraved on the silver plate on the ejector tube."
3,.44 Magnum revolver,4,1, 3.5, 2500,"The .44 Magnum revolver is a double action, swing-out cylinder revolver, with a high damage output for a one-handed gun, but its ammunition is slightly rarer in the wasteland. Additionally, the .44 Magnum fires and reloads quickly, due to its speed-loader and ejector rod. It is, however, somewhat inaccurate with a spread of 0.7, on the high end of one-handed guns. It also has luminescent iron-sights. The .44 Magnum revolver is a very durable weapon that can be concealed with a Sneak skill of 50 or greater, as it is considered an improved holdout weapon."
4,Mysterious Magnum,4,1, 4, 3200,"The Mysterious Magnum is a .44 Magnum revolver that plays the Mysterious Stranger's theme whenever it is drawn or holstered. This revolver features a silver finish with intricate engravings etched all around the weapon, a pearlescent grip, higher damage, and a significantly faster firing rate than a normal .44 Magnum. It can also be concealed so long as one's Sneak skill is at least 50, making it an improved holdout weapon. Like most unique weapons, weapon modifications cannot be used on the Mysterious Magnum."
5,.45 Auto pistol,5,1, 1.5, 1750,"The .45 Auto pistol is a single-action, semi-automatic, magazine-fed handgun that utilizes .45 Auto ammunition. While the .45 AP improved sights modification was cut from the game, the sights are still present on the weapon's default model (pre- and post-modified versions). This gives the .45 Auto pistol luminescent sights, and as such, it is very effective in caves and dark areas."
6,A Light Shining in Darkness,5,1, 1.2, 4500,"A unique variant of the .45 Auto pistol with a much shorter barrel, it features a custom skeletonized hammer and trigger; commander length slide and a snake-skin grip, along with the etched Greek text ""καὶ τὸ φῶς ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ φαίνει (kaì tò phõs én tẽ skotía phaínei)"" on the right side and ""καὶ ἡ σκοτία αὐτὸ οὐ κατέλαβεν (kaì é skotía aútò oú katélaben)"" on the left side, which translates as ""And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.""[1] It also has ""trench"" sights (a groove running along the top of the pistol which the player aims down), rather than having a rear notch and a front post."
7,5.56mm pistol,9,1, 5, 1200,"The 5.56mm pistol is the base variant of That Gun. When compared to That Gun, it is cleaner, has a more intact black finish, two small red LEDs on the side, and a large pale green LED on the back. Just like That Gun, the 5.56mm pistol is a heavily modified, pared down .223 pistol, successor to the same weapon from Fallout and Fallout 2. It weighs a hefty 5 pounds and has a motorized cylinder and crane for quicker shooting and reloading than a typical revolver. The green light on the left side turns yellow while reloading, then turns green and makes a ringing noise once the weapon has reloaded. The two variants of this weapon share the capability to use dedicated armor piercing rounds, a trait which is unique among pistols."
8,That Gun,9,1, 5, 1750,"That Gun is a heavily modified, pared down .223 pistol, successor to the same weapon from Fallout and Fallout 2. It weighs a hefty 5 pounds and has a motorized cylinder and crane for quicker shooting and reloading than a typical revolver. The green light on the left side turns yellow while reloading, then turns green and makes a ringing noise once the weapon has reloaded. Until the advent of the add-on Gun Runners' Arsenal, it had the unique capability of using dedicated armor piercing rounds, something that no other pistol in the game was capable of. That Gun is also the least expensive named rare gun that is available for purchase in Fallout: New Vegas."
9,9mm pistol,10,1, 1.5, 100,"The M&A 9mm pistol is one of the most common guns to be found early on in the game. It is very cheap to buy, utilizes very common ammunition, has no guns skill requirement, and has a very low Strength requirement in order to be handled effectively. It has three-dot luminescent front and rear iron-sights for better low-light fighting, and a minor idle sway."
10,Maria,10,1, 1.5, 1000,"A custom model of an M&A 9mm pistol made by M&A Guns Manufacturers, this weapon has an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a well known Catholic figure and a representation of the biblical Woman of the Apocalypse, painted on the pearl grips of the firearm. The entire body of the pistol is damascened with ivy and floral details, with a polished nickel finish and a golden trigger. It, along with Chance's knife, was responsible for a great number of Fiend deaths in the graphic novel All Roads. It is also the gun used by Benny to shoot the Courier in the Fallout: New Vegas introduction cinematic, and as such is owned by him."
11,10mm pistol,11,1, 3, 750,"Though it is easily obtained, the pistol is prone to breaking after a short period of use, so carefully-aimed shots are important. Its iron-sights are also slightly misaligned, with the front post being aligned slightly to the left of center. However, it does benefit from being considered an improved holdout weapon, and can be concealed and taken into weapon-free locations with a Sneak skill of 50 or greater."
12,Weathered 10mm pistol,11,1, 3, 1200,"Compared to the standard 10mm pistol, this weathered variant has cleaner and more subdued colors tending to gray. It does more damage than the standard 10mm pistol, and is far more durable. In addition, it has no Guns skill requirement for accurate use, compared to a Guns skill of 25 for the standard model. However, despite the standard 10mm pistol being classified as a holdout weapon, this pistol is not. For a weapon obtained at the start of the game, this pistol is a powerful, reliable weapon in most cases."
13,12.7mm pistol,12,1, 3.5, 4000,"The 12.7mm fires and reloads like a 9mm, but packs a more serious punch. This pistol has the third highest base damage-per-second of any non-energy pistol in Fallout: New Vegas, bested only by A Light Shining in Darkness (144.4) and Li'l Devil (GRA) (146.3). It takes a Guns skill of 75 and a Strength of 7 in order to take full advantage of the weapon. Its only drawbacks are its rather poor accuracy (it has the highest weapon spread of any pistol in the game, comparable to even some automatic weapons) and its lack of being a holdout weapon."
14,Li'l Devil,12,1, 3.2, 16000,"Li'l Devil is a unique variant of the 12.7mm pistol. It does greater damage, fires faster, has a greater chance of critical damage, has a lower AP cost and is more accurate. The barrel is also shorter, and has a black synthetic hand grip. Like most unique weapons, modifications cannot be applied."
15,Hunting revolver,6,1, 4, 3500,"The hunting revolver is a large, double-action revolver that fires .45-70 Gov't ammunition. It does a significant amount of damage and comes with a scope as standard, versus requiring a modification. The hunting revolver scope has decent magnification at 2.46x. Its base damage of 58 is the second highest of any non-energy pistol, and is surpassed only by the Ranger Sequoia, which has a base Damage of 62."
16,Ranger Sequoia,6,1, 4, 1200,"This large, double-action revolver is a rare, scopeless variant of the hunting revolver. It is used exclusively by the New California Republic Rangers, and is carried only by a NCR Veteran Ranger after 20 years of service. This revolver features a dark finish with intricate engravings etched all around the weapon. Engraved along the barrel are the words ""For Honorable Service,"" and ""Against All Tyrants."" The hand grip bears the symbol of the NCR Rangers, a bear, and a brass plate attached to the bottom that reads ""20 Years."""
17,Police pistol,3,1, 3, 1000,"The police pistol is a double action .357 revolver with a swing-out cylinder. It features a shorter barrel and a worn matte black (blued) finish. It lacks rear sights and has a shorter hammer with a flat, textured spur."
18,Silenced .22 pistol,1,1, 3, 80,"The silenced .22 pistol is a .22LR round handgun with an integrated silencer. It's classified as a silent weapon, and can be used to attack targets without alerting nearby creatures or NPCs to the player's presence. It also has bonuses to critical hit chance and critical hit damage, making it an effective stealth weapon in tandem with sneak attack criticals. It is a holdout weapon, and as such can be snuck into places where the player's weapons are confiscated. Along with Li'l Devil and the Police pistol, the silenced .22 pistol is one of only three guns that can be used as holdout weapons regardless of the player's Sneak skill."
19,Anti-materiel rifle,7,2, 20, 5600,"This weapon is a .50 caliber bolt-action sniper rifle that is designed for use against military equipment (or ""materiel"" in military terminology). The AMR is similar in design principle to that of a sniper rifle, delivering a high power shot at long distances with great accuracy, although chambered in a larger caliber for hardened targets. As such, the AMR has extremely high damage and low spread and comes pre-equipped with a scope. The magnification level of the scope is 3.13x. Offsetting this is its slow rate of fire, resulting in a low damage-per-second and that the weapon itself weighs 20 pounds, making it one of the heaviest shoulder fired weapons in the game."
20,Assault carbine,8,2, 6, 3950,"The assault carbine is a magazine-fed, compact automatic weapon with a high rate of fire and a comparatively low spread. It is one of the most accurate automatic weapons in the game, and can be effectively used in close and medium range combat. In V.A.T.S. mode, it will shoot a 5 round burst for a cost of 20 Action Points."
21,Automatic rifle,2,2, 16, 4500,"The automatic rifle is a powerful support weapon firing .308 caliber rounds. The weapon holds 20 rounds in a box magazine, has a higher base damage per shot than any other fully-automatic projectile weapon and a comparatively high critical chance."
22,Battle rifle,2,2, 9.5, 1500,"The battle rifle is the GRA variant of This Machine, a gas-operated, semi-automatic rifle chambered for the .308 round, utilizing an internal magazine fed with an en-bloc clip holding 8 rounds."
23,This Machine,2,2, 9.5, 2800,"This Machine is a unique battle rifle chambered in .308 caliber round, holding up to eight rounds at a time and is received in excellent condition thanks to Contreras' personal access to parts. Along the rifle's left side are the words ""WELL THIS MACHINE KILLS COMMIES,"" seeming to imply that this gun was used by American soldiers during the Resource Wars. This rifle is effective in short-to-mid range combat. However, long range combat is difficult because of the gun's relatively wide spread."
24,BB gun,0,2, 2, 36,"As an airgun designed for kids, the BB gun is the weakest gun in the game, even when boosted with the Cowboy perk. It has the notable quality of being silent."
25,Abilene Kid LE BB gun,0,2, 2, 500,"The Abilene Kid LE BB gun is a variant of the standard BB gun, on both sides of the weapon's stock is the inscription ""Abilene Kid ~Limited Edition~ 1 of 200."" Although it shows no significant differences to the standard version when examined in the Pip-Boy 3000, it has a slightly higher Critical Chance and a dramatically higher critical damage bonus, boasting an astounding 70 points of added damage for a critical hit. With the Better Criticals perk, a critical hit from the Abilene Kid LE BB gun is on par with one from a sniper rifle, doing 109 damage total compared to the sniper rifle's 113 and if the perk Just Lucky I'm Alive is also picked the critical hit gets a boost of 125% of damage making the Abilene Kid LE BB gun deal 157 points of damage."
26,Brush gun,6,2, 5, 4900,"One of the main rifles of the NCR Veteran Ranger, the brush gun is a lever-action rifle firing .45-70 Gov't ammunition. It has a semi-buckhorn[6] iron sight similar to the cowboy repeater and the trail carbine."
27,Medicine Stick,6,2, 5.5, 20000,"The Medicine Stick is a variant of the brush gun. It can hold 8 rounds of .45-70 Gov't, has an item HP of 200, an obstructive rear sight, and is clean in appearance. It also features a unique stock with a symbol similar in appearance to a Native American medicine wheel attached to its side. The Medicine Stick inflicts 78 damage in good condition and has a DPS of 108, which can get higher when factoring in perks."
28,Cowboy repeater,3,2, 5, 800,"The cowboy repeater is a lever-action rifle firing small-caliber .357 Magnum rounds. Its iron sights are similar to that of the brush gun and This Machine. Due to the gun having a tube magazine, it is reloaded by hand one bullet at a time, as such it can be interrupted mid-way through reloading and fired if needed. Because of this, it gives the gun the added advantage of being quickly available to fire again if only a single/few rounds are needed."
29,La Longue Carabine,3,2, 5, 1500,"A unique variant of the cowboy repeater, it has a scope which was mounted on the rifle by Corporal Sterling,[1] produces slightly more damage, and reloads faster as it does not load through the loading gate (it lacks one), but through the front of the magazine tube (similar to Lincoln's repeater). Also, the La Longue Carabine is more accurate than a regular cowboy repeater. This spread has been reduced greatly as a result of the patch 1.3.0.452, and it is now slightly more than that of the Marksman carbine."
30,Hunting rifle,2,2, 6, 2200,"The hunting rifle is very similar in appearance to the .32 caliber hunting rifle found in the Capital Wasteland, though differs from the .223 Colt Rangemaster seen previously in New California. Compared to its Capital Wasteland counterpart, it has an iron sight attached and is much more powerful per shot, due to the more powerful round used. This weapon's iron sights are lined with luminescent markers. This hunting rifle is less common than its Capital Wasteland counterpart, as is its ammunition."
31,Paciencia,2,2, 6.2, 12000,"Paciencia is a unique hunting rifle. It has a three-round magazine, but boasts higher damage than the regular variant, as well as higher item HP. Its main advantage over the standard variant is its extremely high critical damage, which is an astounding 110 points, equal to the anti-materiel rifle. Due to its bonus critical chance, critical hits will be more common. It also has a 3.5x magnification when looking down the rifle's iron sights, equivalent to a top-tier scope. However, like many unique weapons, Paciencia cannot be modified using standard hunting rifle mods."
32,Light machine gun,9,2, 15, 5200,"The light machine gun has a decent rate of fire, high magazine capacity, damage, and remarkably fast reload speed. The weapon has moderate spread unless aimed down sights. However, it is very hefty, weighing in at fifteen pounds. The weapon additionally has a Strength requirement of 8 and a Guns requirement of 100, making it difficult to wield. With the requirements and associated perks, this weapon is especially good for killing large packs of enemies, regardless of armor, due to its high rate of fire and its ability to chamber armor piercing ammunition."
33,Bozar,9,2, 15, 20000,"The Bozar is a powerful 5.56mm light machine gun with an ammunition capacity of 30. Although it appears to be a sniper weapon from its mounted scope, it is fully automatic. It has a lower damage per shot than the light machine gun. However, a higher rate of fire, the use of commonly available ammunition, low AP cost, a remarkably fast reload speed, a high DPS, and lower Spread make it a useful weapon for long and medium distances."
34,Marksman carbine,9,2, 6, 5200,"The marksman carbine is a semi-automatic, medium-power rifle with a 20-round magazine. Mounted with an enhanced-zoom scope that shares the same mil-dot reticle as the anti-materiel rifle and sniper rifle, it is highly accurate and deadly at long range with a Guns skill of 100. Additionally, it has a very low Action Point cost of 14, lower than most pistols as well as being the lowest out of any rifle in the game."
35,All-American,9,2, 6, 5900,"The All-American is the unique variant of the semi-automatic Marksman carbine with woodland camouflage, a magazine capacity of 24 and a higher magnification scope. It also bears the distinctive 82nd ""All-American"" Airborne division insignia."
36,Service rifle,9,2, 8.5, 540,"A semi-automatic medium power rifle, this rifle is chambered in the common 5.56mm cartridge and has a magazine capacity of 20 rounds. The rifle is simple yet well made, and since it requires relatively low strength and Guns skill to use accurately, it makes a very reliable weapon often used by New California Republic troopers."
37,Survivalist's rifle,12,2, 8.5, 5400,"This particular rifle once belonged to Randall Clark, an ex-U.S. Army soldier who sought refuge in Zion National Park after the Great War. The rifle was used by the Survivalist for decades, evident by the heavy wear and sun damage on the wood and metal of the gun. It also show signs of improvised repairs, such as the foregrip wood being made from mismatched furniture wood held in place with metal clamps.[1] The barrel is noticeably shorter than a typical service rifle, and the front sight is bent out of shape. The word ""Arrêt!"" (french for ""Halt!"") is carved into one side of the butt of the gun, with ""Stop!"" on the other."
38,Sniper rifle,2,2, 8, 4100,"The sniper rifle is a semi-automatic rifle, designed primarily as a long-range weapon, it deals reasonable damage, has a scope with 3.5x magnification and very little weapons spread."
39,Christine's CoS silencer rifle,2,2, 5.5, 6100,"It is almost physically identical to a sniper rifle, but with a suppressor already attached. The rifle is also a darker color from the standard variant, and its scope has a slight purple hue. It has the highest damage per shot of the .308 weapons in the game. In addition, it has a high DPS, a weight of 5.5 pounds (only slightly heavier than a handful of one-handed guns) and high critical multiplier. Like most unique weapons, it cannot be modified. Due to its low weapon health of 85, it degrades somewhat quickly. The scope of this weapon has a 3.5x magnification."
40,Gobi Campaign scout rifle,2,2, 4.5, 6200,"The Gobi Campaign scout rifle is a unique sniper rifle that was used by the United States Armed Forces in the Gobi Desert military campaign in China before the Great War. The scout rifle is coated in a desert camouflage with a black rubber eye-piece on the scope and comes pre-equipped with an extended magazine, a slightly shorter barrel and a maintenance kit stored in the stock.[1] Its condition deteriorates more slowly than standard sniper rifles."
41,Trail carbine,4,2, 5.5, 3900,"The trail carbine features a good ammunition capacity, great balance of damage and damage-per-second (DPS), brisk rate of fire, and high accuracy. The weapon is also inexpensive to repair, and incredibly durable, withstanding 2495 shots before breaking. Its tubular magazine is reloaded by hand one round at a time, as such it can be interrupted mid-way through reloading and fired if needed."
42,Varmint rifle,9,2, 5.5, 75,"The varmint rifle is a low-powered hunting rifle, designed for hunting varmint and small game such as geckos. It utilizes a magazine-fed bolt-action system and is chambered for 5.56mm caliber rounds."
43,Ratslayer,9,2, 4.5, 2000,"Ratslayer has a black synthetic stock instead of the standard wood, parts that appear to be made from stainless steel, and has 69 tally marks on the stock next to an image of a mole rat's skull."
44,.45 Auto submachine gun,5,3, 11, 3750,"The .45 Auto submachine gun (SMG) is an old two-handed automatic weapon that was stored in U.S. Army and National Guard armories at the time of the war. A large number of them have surfaced after these armories were breached by looters after the war, most notably the White Legs, for whom the .45 SMG has become a signature weapon."
45,9mm submachine gun,10,3, 4, 850,"The 9mm submachine gun is a small, yet capable weapon, able to empty a full magazine in under 3 seconds. The 9mm rounds are common and lightweight, making it even easier to spray-and-pray."
46,Vance's 9mm submachine gun,10,3, 4, 1500,"Vance's 9mm SMG has several differences from the standard 9mm SMG. First and foremost, it does more damage, the damage-per-second is higher, and it has a drum magazine with a greater capacity. Aesthetically, it is in pristine condition with wood or Bakelite grip panels, lacks a stock, and has a different Express-type iron sight."
47,10mm submachine gun,11,3, 5, 2370,"The 10mm submachine gun (SMG) is a one handed automatic weapon. Although the in-game description for the 10mm SMG lists a high damage-per-second (DPS), it shares the common weakness of most shotguns and automatic weapons in Fallout: New Vegas in that much of its theoretical power is negated by the damage threshold system. In addition to losing much of its damage, the high spread of this weapon requires the player character to be at close ranges for all of the rounds fired to impact on the target."
48,Sleepytyme,11,3, 5, 8250,"The 10mm SMG has a proud history in the wasteland, and this variant continues that tradition of excellence. Its integrated suppressor makes it accurate and deathly quiet. Other modifications boost damage and slightly raise the rate of fire, making this weapon a covert powerhouse. It has also been painted a sleek black color compared to its regular cousin. "
49,12.7mm submachine gun,12,3, 5, 5100,"More common at higher levels, the 12.7mm submachine gun is a heavy-duty large caliber submachine gun (SMG). It features an unconventional top-mounted magazine, which lies parallel to the weapon's barrel. It boasts a high damage-per-second, but suffers from a small magazine capacity and a fairly large spread, though this spread is still less than that of the 10mm SMG (as of patch 1.3.0.452). It is also one of only three fully automatic weapons which are capable of being silenced, (the silencer is not to be confused with the 12.7mm pistol silencer, as they are not interchangeable), the others being the silenced .22 SMG and Sleepytyme (GRA)."
50,H&H Tools nail gun,0,3, 4, 5000,"The H&H Tools nail gun was a tool created by H&H Tool Company, now re-purposed as a fully-automatic weapon. It has a layout comparable to a 9mm SMG, with a yellow color. It is fairly common, but has an extremely high resale value. It does double damage to limbs, and although it is a semi silenced weapon, it will still draw attention if fired in close crowds."
51,Silenced .22 SMG,1,3, 8, 1850,"The silenced .22 SMG is a distinctive weapon with its unusual pan magazine, which sits atop the gun rather than under. The silencer is integrated into the barrel with no modifications required."
52,Caravan shotgun,14,4, 3, 675,"This is a double-barreled shotgun that sports barrels mounted in an over-and-under configuration. It features several signs of wear and decay following extensive use in the desert, and has been maintained in a makeshift manner. This is especially clear around the buttstock, where the shoulder pad has been secured with flexible, thin metal strips and duct-tape. The rusting barrels are kept together with zip-ties and scraps of tightly-wrapped leather. Furthermore, they appear to have been sawed-off."
53,Sturdy caravan shotgun,14,4, 3, 875,"This weapon is an ""over-and-under"" shotgun with a pattern/logo cut into the stock and an engraving of two birds on the frame. Despite its rough appearance this caravan shotgun is extremely durable, with more than twice the item health of a normal caravan shotgun, hence the name. There is some sort of tally mark scratched into both the back of the gun and beside the trigger. The gun is duct-taped at its butt and at a crack in the wood closest to the barrel."
54,Hunting shotgun,13,4, 7.5, 3800,"The hunting shotgun was built for greater range and power over similar shotguns. Using the less common but more powerful 12 gauge shells, the hunting shotgun is designed to be the mid-to-end game shotgun class weapon, only outclassed by the riot shotgun."
55,Dinner Bell,13,4, 7.5, 4800,"Dinner Bell is a unique variant of the hunting shotgun. It differs in appearance to the standard shotgun with the metal of the barrel, receiver, and shell ejection port seem to appear to be more well-maintained, and that the stock and pump are synthetic with a camouflage pattern."
56,Lever-action shotgun,14,4, 3, 2000,"Adding to the variety of shotguns found in Fallout: New Vegas, this shotgun has a lever-action (similar to the cowboy repeater) and fires a 20 gauge shotgun shell. It has the highest damage-per-second of all 20-gauge shotguns. The only real disadvantages to the lever-action are the ammunition capacity and the fact that it must be single-loaded instead of feeding from a detachable magazine. Additionally, the time it takes for the player to open up and close the lever action at the start and end of the reloading cycle takes an extraordinarily long time, meaning that attempting to load and fire individual shells will reduce the effective fire rate significantly."
57,Riot shotgun,13,4, 5, 5500,"The riot shotgun is a semi-automatic shotgun with a drum magazine. It has a high damage-per-second, due in part to its large ammunition capacity when compared to other shotguns, and its high rate of fire. With the Shotgun Surgeon and And Stay Back perks, it can be a very devastating weapon in close quarters combat. It also reloads much faster than any other shotgun and therefore can change ammunition types very quickly. It also has the distinction of having the lowest Action point cost of all shotguns at 17 AP per shot which is comparable to some pistols, making it very useful for VATS dependent player characters."
58,Sawed-off shotgun,13,4, 4, 1950,"The sawed-off shotgun is a break action, 12 gauge shotgun with most of the original barrel and stock removed to make it smaller and more easily concealed at the expense of range. Pulling the trigger fires both barrels at once, unleashing 14 pellets instead of the typical 7. While its damage-per-second is low, it inflicts incredible burst damage at close range. The shotgun's base damage in Fallout: New Vegas is double that of its counterpart in Fallout 3 - in fact, it inflicts more damage per shot than any other non-unique shotgun (Big Boomer inflicts an extra 20 points), and is second only to the anti-materiel rifle as the most powerful non-unique conventional firearm in the game."
59,Big Boomer,13,4, 4, 2500,"The Big Boomer is a sawed-off shotgun with the same break action, 12 gauge that fires both shells at a time, delivering 14 pellets at a time instead of the typical 7 of other shotguns."
60,Single shotgun,14,4, 7, 175,"Along with the varmint rifle, the 9mm pistol and laser pistol, the single shotgun is available to the player at the lowest levels of the game and has the highest single shot damage of the four. Though it only carries a single round of ammunition, it has a fast reload speed that allows multiple shots in a single V.A.T.S. round and is quite accurate for a shotgun (however it does use an extensive amount of Action Point cost of 45 AP), with the second lowest weapons spread after Dinner Bell."
61,K9000 cyberdog gun,3,5, 27, 7500,"This weapon is actually an odd form of cyberdog, except instead of a robotic body in the image of a canine companion, a living dog's brain has been provided with a machine gun frame, utilizing .357 Magnum ammunition. Its ""canine"" features include two metallic ""ears"" mounted on top of the weapon that move like a real dog's and a sniffer mounted on the jar containing its preserved brain, allowing the gun to sense its surroundings. The metal ears also appear to move up and down faster if the gun is pointing in the direction of an enemy."
62,FIDO,4,5, 27, 9500,"Unlike the K9000 cyberdog gun, FIDO uses .44 Magnum rounds instead of .357 Magnum rounds, resulting in higher damage and a slightly higher spread. The brain case and the scope are red instead of green and the decal is changed from a golden retriever to a bulldog. Other features of the K9000 cyberdog gun are included in FIDO."
63,Minigun,8,5, 25, 5500,"This weapon is a six-barreled heavy machine gun, fed by a ""cassette"" ammunition box using the 5mm round. Utilizing the Gatling style rotating barrels powered by an internal motor, it delivers an extremely high rate of fire, making it an effective weapon and is ideal for inflicting heavy damage on large quantities of relatively unarmored enemies. With the use of armor piercing ammunition, the minigun is extremely deadly, being able to cut through even the toughest target very fast, the downside being that it uses up the 5mm ammunition rather quickly."
64,CZ57 Avenger,8,5, 18, 8500,"The CZ57 Avenger minigun is a unique version of the regular minigun. In comparison, it deals slightly more damage per shot than the regular counterpart. This is further augmented by a vastly greater rate of fire, giving it the highest damage-per-second of any weapon in Fallout: New Vegas. Additionally, the weapons spread is reduced to just over half of that of the normal minigun, giving it better accuracy over longer distances. However, the standard minigun holds twice as much ammunition in a belt than the CZ57 Avenger, giving the CZ57 Avenger only 4 seconds of continuous fire before needing to reload, but this does reduce the overall weight of the weapon from 25 pounds to 18 pounds. The name and model of the Avenger is also printed on the side of the ammunition pack."
65,Shoulder mounted machine gun,11,5, 17, 7500,"The shoulder mounted machine gun is essentially a shoulder-mounted minigun. It is chamberered to use 10mm rounds and has a low rate of fire compared to other heavy automatic weapons. It has the highest damage per round of weapons chambered for the 10mm round. However, it can be difficult to maintain, as only other SMMGs can repair it, even with Jury Rigging, and it is extremely expensive to repair unless the player character has a ready supply of weapon repair kits. Alternatively, if the first rank of ED-E's upgrades was found, repairing this gun will not be a problem."
66,Alien blaster,20,6, 2, 4000,"The alien blaster is one of the most powerful weapons in the game because a Critical Hit is guaranteed. This weapon will often be able to take down any foe with a single shot to the head. Enemies killed by a critical hit from this weapon are disintegrated into ash, identical to a laser with the exception that the disintegration effect is colored blue instead of red."
67,Euclid's C-Finder,0,6, 15, 1,"“The raw power of the sun, contained in an easy-to-carry package! Just point the handheld rangefinder at the bad guys, and pull the trigger!”"
68,Flare gun,23,6, 2, 500,"A short-barreled, breech-loading signal pistol which can also be used as a weapon. It launches its projectile in an arc, and can be used for long-range indirect fire when aimed outside of V.A.T.S. After damage caused by the initial hit, affected targets will take additional fire damage for a short time."
69,Laser pistol,22,6, 3, 175,"The laser pistol returns as the entry level energy pistol in Fallout: New Vegas. The laser pistol is one of the weakest energy pistols, but is also the most common. Unlike the majority of the weapons in New Vegas, the laser pistol does not have a ""true iron sights"" function."
70,Compliance Regulator,22,6, 3, 175,"The Compliance Regulator is an electroshock weapon and a unique version of the standard laser pistol, in that not only does it fire a blue beam instead of the normal red, but dealing a Critical Hit upon an enemy will paralyze them for 10 seconds."
71,Missing laser pistol,22,6, 3, 175,The missing laser pistol is a unique version of the laser pistol that is only found during the unmarked quest Pistol Packing. It also has the same stats as the standard laser pistol with the exception of lower damage and critical damage.
72,Pew Pew,22,6, 3, 2498,"The upper casing of Pew Pew is colored red, and the focus adjustment knob on the rear of the gun has a Sunset Sarsaparilla bottle cap with a crudely drawn star attached by a screw. Underneath the bottle cap are the words ""Had it coming"" etched into the casing, along with eight hash marks. Additional hash marks also appear along both sides and the underside of the main body of the pistol."
73,Plasma Defender,22,6, 2, 3000,"The Plasma Defender is a powerful energy-based pistol which fires superheated bolts of green plasma. It is able to punch through most critters and low-level armor with ease, when compared to the more commonly found and cheaper laser pistol."
74,Plasma pistol,22,6, 3, 200,"The plasma pistol is a powerful energy-based pistol, firing a superheated bolts of green plasma, it is able to punch through most critters and low-level types of armor with ease."
75,Pulse gun,22,6, 2, 1800,"The pulse gun is an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) based weapon, similar in principle to that of pulse grenades and pulse mines, it delivers additional bonus damage to robots and those wearing power armor."
76,Recharger pistol,24,6, 7, 2700,"The recharger pistol is the second version[1] of a self-charging weapon with effectively limitless ammunition. It's a more advanced and compact version of the recharger rifle that is fitted with a microfusion breeder that provides it a virtually limitless power supply, capped at 20 shots. Recharging time takes 1 second to recharge 1 shot and a fully discharged recharger pistol takes 20 seconds to fully charge. Additionally, it will only recharge while equipped and does not start out charged when equipping it, resulting in having to wait for it to charge before firing."
77,MF Hyperbreeder Alpha,24,6, 7, 8900,"The Microfusion Hyperbreeder Alpha is a unique variant of the recharger pistol that has been modified to be fully automatic. The Hyperbreeder also recharges much faster than its standard non GRA counterpart, allowing for a higher rate of fire. It also deals more damage per shot fired than the standard variant. Its high recharge rate is somewhat mitigated by its noticeably smaller magazine capacity, allowing for only half as many shots as the common variant before recharging. Also, as with most unique weapons, it lacks the ability to be modified. It also has high spread, limiting the effective range."
78,Sonic emitter - Gabriel's bark,22,6, 2, 3500,"The sonic emitter - Gabriel's bark is an Energy Weapons pistol with bonus damage against robots and power armor wearers, as well as a unique ""critical strike knockback"" effect, knocking enemies down on critical strikes. This sonic emitter is named after the cyberdog Gabriel, and the holodisk containing the upgrade is found in one of Gabriel's digging spots. This sonic emitter modulation has a burgundy oscilloscope."
79,Sonic emitter - opera singer,22,6, 2, 3500,"The sonic emitter - opera singer is an Energy Weapons pistol with bonus damage against robots and power armor wearers, as well as a unique ""critical strike dismemberment"" effect, crippling the target's limbs and reducing its total HP by 20 HP on critical strikes. A lethal critical hit will dismember the target, even if the Bloody Mess perk is not active. This sonic emitter modulation has a red oscilloscope."
80,Sonic emitter - revelation,22,6, 2, 3500,"The pistol's chassis is composed of a grey metallic tube outfitted with four vacuum tubes, a housing for a small energy cell, a conical muzzle, and a rear-mounted oscilloscope, all attached to a pistol grip. It shares some visual features with other pistol-grip energy weapons, such as the pulse gun, Euclid's C-Finder, and the recharger pistol. When the trigger is pulled, the vacuum tubes light up as the weapon charges for a moment before firing concentric rings of blue energy at the target."
81,Sonic emitter - robo-scorpion,22,6, 2, 3500,"The sonic emitter - robo-scorpion is an Energy Weapons pistol with bonus damage against robots and power armor wearers, as well as a unique ""critical strike explosion"" effect. The projectile fired from this modulation travels noticeably slower than other modulations and it uses 3 energy cells per shot as opposed to 1 or 2 with the other variations. This sonic emitter modulation has a yellow oscilloscope. It also has a slight firing delay."
82,Sonic emitter - tarantula,22,6, 2, 3500,"The sonic emitter - tarantula is an Energy Weapons pistol with bonus damage against robots and power armor wearers, as well as a unique ""critical strike incendiary"" effect which ignites the target on a critical hit. This modulation of the sonic emitter has a purple oscilloscope."
83,Gauss rifle,24,7, 7, 3000,"The scoped Gauss rifle is an advanced sniper rifle that uses a series of eleven electromagnetic coils to energize and magnetize a preloaded standard projectile round to a tremendous speed.[1] In appearance, it is almost identical to the Gauss rifle acquired after finishing the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage, apart from the addition of an extra pad on the buttstock."
84,186,24,7, 8, 3000,"The YCS/186 is a unique variant of the Gauss rifle. It looks like a standard Gauss rifle, but with a sandy or rusted texture along the barrel and main body, and it sports black stripes on the wooden stock. It has 4 more coils around the barrel, possibly explaining the greater weight and damage, while remaining the same length. The lens of the scope is tinted an unusual shade of red. The YCS/186 uses 4 microfusion cells per shot, instead of the normal 5 of a standard Gauss rifle. It is slightly more accurate and has 20 more item HP than the standard variety. Its only drawback over the base model is a slightly increased weight, at 8 pounds instead of 7."
85,Holorifle,24,7, 8, 3000,"The holorifle is a scoped, pump-action energy based weapon. The weapon's main body is similar in appearance to that of a grenade launcher. The scope of the weapon also appears similar to that of a laser rifle scope, but with the advantage that the holorifle's scope features integrated night vision. However, the magnification level of the holorifle scope is only 2.86x, compared to the 3.5x magnification of the laser rifle scope."
86,LAER,24,7, 4, 8000,"The LAER resembles a mix of many existing energy weapons; the barrel looks like the pulse gun, the microfusion cell is held in a basket on the bottom like a plasma rifle, the stock is similar to a laser rifle, and it displays vacuum tubes similar to a recharger rifle. It also offers very high damage (on par with the plasma caster) for low ammunition consumption making it a great all around weapon."
87,Elijah's advanced LAER,24,7, 4, 8500,"This weapon is identical to the LAER in appearance, but differs in ammunition capacity by having five fewer shots per magazine and a slightly increased rate of fire. This gives it a higher damage-per-second (DPS), but also makes it much less durable. Given the original variant's fragility, its condition is a major concern, especially when using over-charged, optimized, or max charge ammunition."
88,Laser RCW,21,7, 4, 2150,"With adequate Energy Weapons skill and Strength, this weapon exhibits moderate accuracy due to a high spread for a laser weapon, making it useful for taking down enemies at almost any range. As a direct energy weapon, it has no recoil, allowing for continuous fire without muzzle climb. However, using it extensively on full-auto requires large amounts of ammunition. A partial solution to this problem is to apply the Laser RCW recycler modification, which recycles every fourth discharge. It also has the second lowest critical chance of any energy weapon in the entire game."
89,Laser rifle,24,7, 8, 800,"The laser rifle has no iron sights, but compensates with excellent zoom. It can be upgraded with a scope, making it less effective in close quarters, but thanks to its good accuracy, it can be used as a medium to long-range weapon. The laser rifle makes a decent starting weapon, but with all mods it is extremely powerful, even at high levels."
90,AER14 prototype,24,7, 8.5, 2200,"The AER14 uses two microfusion cells per shot and has a unique green laser instead of the normal red laser, different from a standard laser rifle. It doesn't have iron sights view and cannot be modded using laser rifle mods, though it can be repaired with normal laser rifles. The AER14 is also visually longer than the standard AER9 laser rifle."
91,Van Graff laser rifle,24,7, 8, 800,"A unique variant of the AER9 laser rifle received from the Van Graffs. It is received in max condition. Overall, it has less damage, less item HP and less critical damage but requires less Energy Weapons skill (0 as opposed to 25)."
92,Multiplas rifle,24,7, 7, 2500,"The multiplas rifle is a plasma-based weapon, bearing a similar appearance to the plasma rifle. It is most easily distinguished by its three plasma barrels at the rifle's tip, which fire three very destructive rounds of plasma. It uses one round per projectile, for a total ammunition consumption of three rounds per trigger press. Like most plasma-based weapons, the multiplas rifle causes a large green burst of plasma upon firing which partially obstructs view. In addition, the plasma bolts travel at a slow rate, resulting in the need to lead the shot."
93,Plasma rifle,24,7, 8, 1300,"Compared to its Fallout 3 counterpart, this plasma rifle has a much lower damage-per-second rating with only a slight improvement in damage. Factoring in the transition from the Damage Resistance system to the Damage Threshold system, the plasma rifle is vastly underpowered compared to its Fallout 3 iteration."
94,Van Graff plasma rifle,24,7, 8, 1300,This weapon is a unique variant of the plasma rifle and is received in max condition from the Van Graffs. This variant consumes microfusion cells at the same rate as the standard plasma rifle.
95,Q-35 matter modulator,24,7, 7, 3000,There are numerous differences between this weapon and the standard variant in terms of combat capability:
96,Recharger rifle,24,7, 15, 250,"It recharges itself at about a round every second, requiring the player to pace their shots to compensate."
97,Tri-beam laser rifle,24,7, 9, 4800,"The tri-beam laser rifle has the appearance of a ""sawed-off"" laser rifle, missing the tube on the bottom length of the barrel, being rather shorter than other models, and having a new emitter aperture and attached wires. The new emitter fires three laser beams with each shot. While uncommon in the wasteland, it can be readily found with the New Vegas Brotherhood of Steel. It uses 3 microfusion cells when fired. This weapon  degrades very quickly and is very expensive to repair. With the Jury Rigging perk it can be repaired by normal laser rifles."
98,Arc welder,21,8, 15, 3700,"The arc welder is essentially an electrostatic discharge gun using electron charge packs, capable of shooting a constant, high-voltage stream of lightning, similar to how a flamer expels burning gas. It does bonus damage against robots (+8) and power armor (+4), excluding NCR salvaged power armor. With it equipped, the Courier wears a backpack with similar texture to the weapon itself, akin to the flamer."
99,Flamer,23,8, 15, 2350,"It is identical to the the Fallout 3 version, but can now be modded with the flamer expanded tanks. Also, it is now an Energy Weapon instead of a Big Gun like in Fallout 3. With a high enough Energy Weapons skill, the flamer is an extremely effective weapon at killing all forms of unarmored and lightly armored enemies (giant ants, most humans, cazadores, mantis, and spore carriers). It produces a cone of fire from the nozzle, capable of hitting multiple enemies or allies simultaneously. Additionally, it is capable of hitting multiple body parts and inflicting widespread damage."
100,Cleansing Flame,23,8, 22, 9500,"Cleansing Flame is a modified, high-capacity flamer. Unlike the standard variant it has three jet nozzles, three large fuel tanks, and orange cables. The flame jet is blue rather than the usual red, indicating that the flame burns hotter than standard flamers."
101,Gatling laser,21,8, 18, 6800,"This weapon has a Strength requirement of 8 to use effectively and uses electron charge packs as ammunition. It deals very high damage per second (DPS), particularly when used with a high Energy Weapons skill, focus optics mod and max-charged or over-charged ammunition."
102,Sprtel-Wood 9700,21,8, 15, 20000,"The Sprtel-Wood 9700 is a high-speed Gatling laser that shoots green lasers, similar to the AER14 prototype. It has an ammunition capacity of 90 electron charge packs and moderate weapon spread. The Sprtel-Wood 9700 can inflict 16 damage per hit in good condition, but it has a slightly below-average critical hit chance for an automatic weapon."
103,Heavy incinerator,23,8, 15, 7200,"Visually, the heavy incinerator is similar to the regular incinerator, but with an additional fuel tank and hose attached to the side. Firing at a faster rate than its smaller cousin, its rate of fire is equivalent to the heavy incinerator in Fallout 3. Like the incinerator, it lobs large fireballs in a large arc similar to the grenade machinegun. It has greater range and damage compared to the regular incinerator, but less accuracy."
104,Incinerator,23,8, 12, 1300,"This weapon launches balls of fire which ignite foes from a distance (unlike its sibling, the flamer, which requires the user to be in close proximity of its foe). It's notably different from the heavy incinerator as it has a slower rate of fire, shorter range, and a less potent projectile. It does, however, possess a smaller spread."
105,Plasma caster,24,8, 20, 7000,"The plasma caster is a powerful energy weapon, having a rather low AP cost and high rate of fire. Compared to its rifle-based counterpart, it outclasses it in both damage and fire rate as well as ammunition consumption, using only one Microfusion cell instead of two per shot. Finally, it is slightly more durable. It pays for these advantages however in weight and accuracy: its far larger base spread is compounded by the insane skill and strength requirements to handle this weapon, and at 20 pounds it is the heaviest energy weapon in the game save for the GRA Cleansing Flame. Finally, it is rare and not very durable so the Jury Rigging perk or weapon repair kits may be necessary for continuous use of this weapon."
106,The Smitty Special,24,8, 20, 20000,"This weapon is a GRA plasma caster with numerous modifications to increase performance. Most notably, it features a shorter barrel with larger, fan-shaped magnetic stabilizing claws on the end, and thick orange tape around the shaft. The body is also cleaner and darker green in color, with additional hardware on the side and one large yellow vacuum tube replacing two of the tubes on the front-right side."
107,Tesla cannon,21,8, 8, 8700,The Tesla cannon is a shoulder-mounted energy weapon that is powered by electron charge packs. This weapon has a high Strength requirement for its weight and the fact that it's a recoilless energy weapon. The sound of the Tesla cannon firing has also been changed from the one in Broken Steel. The Tesla cannon is considered a unique class of weapon and therefore cannot benefit from the Jury Rigging perk.
108,Elijah's jury-rigged Tesla cannon,21,8, 8, 13500,"This weapon is identical in appearance to the Tesla-Beaton prototype, although its damage is between that and the regular Tesla cannon. It also holds more ammunition, allowing for six shots to be fired before reloading and is more durable than the Tesla-Beaton prototype, while only inflicting slightly less damage. It has the benefit of no spread at all, allowing for accurate fire if the skill requirements are met. Even though the weapon is slightly more practical than its counterparts in direct combat, its high value and low durability make it the most costly model to maintain with repeated use."
109,Tesla-Beaton prototype,21,8, 8, 12525,"The Tesla-Beaton prototype appears to be similar to the Tesla cannon, but with an orange glow instead of blue, and a fully encased energy emitter. It also has several exposed wires and various lights attached to the casing, giving it a more makeshift appearance. Prior to patch 1.3.0.452, each shot expended 45 electron charge packs, but it now expends 6 electron charge packs per shot, with a magazine capacity of 24. Also, the patch removed the prototype's AOE blast damage. Unlike the original Tesla cannon, it only has half the HP. This is likely due to it being in the prototype stage. Because of this issue, the need for constant repair makes it a less practical weapon for repeated use."
110,25mm grenade APW,none,9, 8, 4200,"The 25mm grenade APW is a semi-automatic grenade launcher. It gives the player the death-dealing capability of the grenade machinegun in a more portable package. Specifically, this weapon contains a stock magazine capacity of six grenades, a brisk rate of fire, decent accuracy and allows modifications. "
111,Fat Man,none,9, 30, 6000,"The Fat Man is a shoulder-mounted tactical nuclear catapult. It is heavy, especially in Hardcore mode when combined with its mini nuke ammunition, but very powerful."
112,Esther,none,9, 40, 18000,"Esther is a unique, heavily modified Fat Man with a different rear mechanism, a blast shield, a light-blue body, and a thick clear glass or plastic bed holding the mini nukes. It is 10 pounds heavier than a standard Fat Man. However, it is more durable, never jams, costs 10 less Action Points per attack, is more powerful by 75 direct damage compared to the Fat Man, and is able to use the GRA mini nuke ammo types. "
113,Grenade machinegun,none,9, 15, 5200,"The grenade machinegun is a powerful rapid-fire weapon which uses 25mm ammunition. The attached computer monitor appears to show the weapon's feed system and other details, although this is purely cosmetic and does not reflect actual use."
114,Mercy,none,9, 15, 5200,"Its higher damage comes at the cost of using 40mm grenades, which are less common and more expensive than the 25mm grenade used by standard grenade machineguns. The larger size of the 40mm grenades also restricts its ammunition capacity to 18 grenades, which is 12 fewer than the regular grenade machinegun. The 40mm grenade is also heavier than its 25mm counterpart, further limiting the amount of ammo the player can carry in hardcore mode without being over-encumbered. Like most unique weapons, Mercy cannot be modded. This weapon looks extremely rusted and heavily used.  "
115,Grenade launcher,none,9, 12, 4200,"The grenade launcher is a pump-action operated weapon, firing 40mm grenades from a tubular magazine. Despite being only slightly larger than the grenade rifle, it has twice the weight."
116,Grenade rifle,none,9, 6, 300,"The grenade rifle launches 40mm grenades over a respectable distance. Although its range is longer than regular hand grenades and the fuse is impact-triggered instead of timed, its ammunition is less powerful and its single-shot, break-action design makes rapid fire impossible. Unlike the grenade launcher, it requires a Strength of 3 to carry."
117,Great Bear grenade rifle,none,9, 5, 950,"It has the appearance of a grenade rifle, but with a blue American Army-like symbol on the stock."
118,Mercenary's grenade rifle,none,9, 5.5, 300,"Very similar to other 40mm grenade rifles in the Mojave Wasteland; the only differences are the darker tone of both the wood and metal, lighter weight and no requirement of 25 in Explosives skill. Unlike the majority of unique weapons variants, it can be modded with the grenade rifle long barrel."
119,Red Victory grenade rifle,none,9, 4, 950,"It has the appearance of a grenade rifle, but with a red and yellow Chinese flag design on the stock. It was brought in as a gift for a general in the United States military and is found with a number of 40mm grenade rifle rounds. "
120,Thump-Thump,none,9, 5.5, 800,"Thump-Thump is a unique grenade rifle which has the extended range of a barrel extension mod found in its common counterparts and enhanced AoE radius. It also has 30% faster attack speed, 0.5 lower weight, and is 25% more durable compared to a standard grenade rifle. It also has a unique texture and the words ""Thump-Thump"" scrawled on the side with an arrow pointing towards the muzzle. There is also a drawing of an angry beaver with red eyes holding a rifle on the stock. Standard 40mm grenades fired from this weapon will have twice the velocity as ones fired from other grenade rifles."
121,Missile launcher,none,9, 20, 3900,"The missile launcher is a shoulder-fired Explosives weapon. It is heavy but powerful, and can fire several types of missiles. Multiple enemies can be hit with a single shot due to the blast radius of the explosion. Enemies not killed by the blast will often have multiple limbs crippled and will be easier to dispatch."
122,Annabelle,none,9, 15, 5200,"Annabelle is a unique missile launcher which appears to have a long history of service. Drawings on the front show a maple leaf with four markings and the stars from the Chinese flag, indicating that the weapon was used during the annexation of Canada and in at least one military campaign in China. The drawing on the back of the launcher reads ""Annabelle."""
123,Red Glare,none,9, 20, 15000,"Red Glare feeds from a 13 round rocket canister and is fully automatic, capable of emptying its magazine in a matter of seconds. It is fitted with a scope, which makes it effective at mid to long range. A bright red light is emitted from the weapon when firing, as well as from the rockets during flight and impact."
124,Dynamite,none,10, 0.3, 25," Dynamite comes in sticks with fuses that stick out of them. Once lit, they are tossed at a hostile and will damage or kill them. It only requires 1 Strength to use this very lightweight explosive weapon. However, it has a rather small blast radius for an explosive, which reduces its effectiveness against groups of enemies, while at the same time making it less of a friendly fire hazard.
 Alternatively, one may place it on the ground by dropping it and then detonate it by gun fire or another explosive. Unlit dynamite sticks detonated by external means deal 75 explosion damage, unaffected by the Courier's skill or perks. Dropping multiple sticks as a single pack will only yield the effect of a single stick. Detonating dropped sticks will add up, however.
 Contrary, when an ignited (thrown) dynamite is shot the resulting explosion deals no damage.
 Despite having words ""inert"" on both sides of the stick, near the fuse, the stick of dynamite is very much capable of exploding.
 It also has two American flags on each side of the stick, which look like the real-world American flag, as opposed to the different design used in the Fallout universe.
 The fuse takes 3 seconds to burn."
125,Fire bomb,none,10, 0.5, 200,"It is a Molotov cocktail made out of a Sunset Sarsaparilla bottle, filled with a flammable substance and stuffed with a rag to ignite it. It will also turn enemies into piles of green goo if the killing blow is a Critical Hit, similar to that of plasma-based energy weapons."
126,Flash bang,none,10, 0.5, 50,"The flash bang is a different type of grenade that deals fatigue damage. In addition, they also reduce enemy weapon skills and have a chance to frenzy tunnelers. Upon detonation, the grenade releases a large explosion of blue colored energy."
127,Frag grenade,none,10, 0.5, 150,"The standard thrown explosive device used by militaries worldwide before the Great War, the frag grenade causes a lethal blast sending metal shrapnel flying in all directions up to 35 meters. Useful against groups of unarmored enemies, or for hitting enemies around corners by banking grenades off walls. To throw the frag grenade, simply press the Fire button, the longer it is held the farther the grenade will go. The arc at which the player is throwing it is also a major factor for determining the distance it will travel and land."
128,Holy Frag Grenade,none,10, 0.5, 500,"In appearance they look similar to a normal frag grenade, with the exception of a white cross painted on the side. When detonated, rather than a normal frag grenade explosion, Holy Frag Grenades explode in a manner similar to a mini nuke. There will also be radiation in the area it detonated. "
129,Incendiary grenade,none,10, 0.5, 200,"The incendiary grenade is a thrown explosive device. Targets caught in the blast radius will take fire damage, and continue to burn for several seconds after the initial detonation."
130,Long-fuse dynamite,none,10, 0.3, 25,"Long-fuse dynamite is just like normal dynamite but, as the name suggests, has a longer fuse, which lasts for 6 seconds. Unlike powder charges, dynamite explodes when you shoot it, either in the hand of an enemy or on the ground when it is dropped. If you'd rather not wait for six seconds, use V.A.T.S. to deliver the throw. Your target tends to wait patiently for the dynamite to explode."
131,MFC grenade,none,10, 0.5, 15,"The MFC grenade is a powerful improvised weapon, created by converting three microfusion cells into a thrown explosive device. It has a wide blast radius and similar visual effects to a plasma grenade."
132,Nuka-grenade,none,10, 0.5, 50,"The Nuka-grenade is an extremely powerful improvised explosive device. It incorporates the radioactive properties of a relatively rare Nuka-Cola variant to produce an enhanced plasma blast. Upon detonation, the target area also becomes irradiated for a short time afterwards."
133,Plasma grenade,none,10, 0.5, 300,The plasma grenade packs more punch than the standard frag grenade and can turn enemies into puddles of glowing green goo if a Critical Hit is achieved. Plasma grenades are also a Holdout weapon.
134,Pulse grenade,none,10, 0.5, 40,"When combined with mid to high explosives skill, the pulse grenade makes very short work of any sentry bot, protectron, Mister Handy, or any other drones or turrets. The pulse grenade is one of the most effective anti-robot weapons in the game, next to the pulse gun. Visually, when used the pulse grenade will make an electrical sphere, damaging anything inside. It can be enhanced with various perks, such as Demolition Expert, and Splash Damage. It only does light-to-moderate damage to non-robot enemies, but is also very effective against enemies wearing power armor."
135,Tin grenade,none,10, 0.5, 25,"The tin grenade is an improvised thrown explosive device; it is created at a workbench and assembled from scrap. A tin can is used for both the casing and for shrapnel, pistol powder for the explosive and duct tape to hold it all together. The tin grenade can be used to complete the Gun Runners' Arsenal challenge called Crackerjack Timing."
136,Bottlecap mine,none,11, 0.5, 150,"The bottlecap mine is a powerful improvised weapon. It functions like other proximity mines, but takes the player slightly more time to arm and drop. It also has a longer warning sound before detonating. Like other placed explosives, it cannot be used in V.A.T.S."
137,C-4 plastic explosive,none,11, 0.5, 1000,"The M112 Demolition Charge model of C-4 plastic explosive is a powerful, high-tier explosive weapon. It can be placed on the ground like proximity mines, but will not detonate when enemies are near- instead, one must use the detonator to set them off. This makes C-4 useful for setting traps to kill unsuspecting enemies by placing it in their path, moving far away and setting off the explosive. If multiple C-4 charges are dropped, they will all go off simultaneously when the detonator is activated."
138,Demolition charge,none,11, 1.5, 75,"The demolition charge looks similar to a normal frag mine but has a black striped yellow case and a bright yellow light, rather than a small red one."
139,Detonator,none,11, 0.5, 25,"The detonator is specifically used to detonate C-4 after it is planted. During Eureka!, it may also be used to detonate a generator at the Hoover Dam checkpoint after hacking a Very Hard terminal. The tool itself has no other use, and is unable to harm enemies by itself."
140,Fat mine,none,11, 3.25, 275,"The fat mine is a mine, created by converting a mini nuke into a placed improvised explosive device. Like other mines, it cannot be used in V.A.T.S.."
141,Frag mine,none,11, 0.5, 75,The frag mine is a placed explosive device. When approached by an enemy it emits a beep shortly before exploding. It can be disarmed while close to it by interacting with it.
142,Gas bomb,none,11, 5, 100,The gas bomb is an improvised explosive incendiary device. It is constructed from sensor modules strapped to a fire extinguisher.
143,MFC cluster,none,11, 0.5, 110,"The MFC cluster is a powerful improvised explosive weapon. It is essentially six independent MFC grenades wrapped up together and rigged to explode like mines (in keeping with this theme, note that the MFC cluster requires six times as many microfusion cells as one MFC grenade). When used, the player flings all six of the mines at the same time, which then separate into six different projectiles. The mines bounce off surfaces when thrown, and can cover a large distance very quickly by ricocheting."
144,Plasma mine,none,11, 0.5, 300,"A mine that can be placed on the ground. When it senses an enemy movement in a small radius, it releases a powerful burst of plasma."
145,Powder charge,none,11, 0.5, 25,"The powder charge is a crude improvised explosive consisting of a sealed tin can packed with dynamite, with a sensor module duct-taped to the side."
146,Pulse mine,none,11, 0.5, 40,"It is a mine that can be placed on the ground. When stepped on by an enemy, it releases a powerful burst of electricity similar to the pulse grenade. It deals substantial damage to robots and characters wearing power armor, but only minor damage to other targets. Despite the very low damage output, reverse pickpocketing one will still kill the target but will cause very little damage to the Courier if they can't get out of the blast radius."
147,Satchel charge,none,11, 0.75, 125,"The satchel charge is a placed explosive, and functions like other proximity mines. However, it has a significantly shorter fuse than other types. Unusually, even players with a very high Explosives skill will set off enemy-placed charges almost immediately. It is deceptively powerful for the simplicity of its construction, besting even the bottlecap mine, often crippling a limb upon detonation if one gets caught in the blast. The satchel charge also bests the bottlecap mine by being far easier to craft and using far more common materials. This is offset by its higher Strength and skill requirements, as well as its weight."
148,Time bomb,none,11, 0.5, 750,"The time bomb is an improvised explosive weapon. Unlike a proximity mine, once activated it cannot be disarmed, and will automatically detonate after 15 seconds. It is a placed explosive, and cannot be used in V.A.T.S. While most other placed explosives are flat, the time bomb is rounded, and thus it is capable of rolling down inclines and bouncing off objects instead of remaining in place once set. This weapon can be used to earn the Gun Runners' Arsenal challenge, Crackerjack Timing."
149,"Time bomb, high yield",none,11, 0.5, 750,"The high yield time bomb is a more powerful version of the improvised Explosives weapon. It is a placed explosive, and as such cannot be thrown like a grenade or used in V.A.T.S. Unlike a proximity mine, once activated, it will automatically detonate after 15 seconds."
150,Bowie knife,none,12, 1, 1000,"The Bowie knife has a large clip-point blade and a riveted brown handle. Small contact marks mar the edge, and streaks of what appears to be blood can be seen running across the sides of the blade and the hilt. The blade is stamped with the serial number 02280."
151,Blood-Nap,none,12, 1, 2000,"Blood-Nap is a unique variant of the Bowie knife that does bonus critical damage, gives a bonus critical chance and adds +10 to Sneak."
152,Bumper sword,none,12, 12, 2500,"The bumper sword, as the name suggests, consists of a rusty car bumper that has been flattened and sharpened into a thick, heavy blade. The license plate is still attached, and an exhaust pipe strapped to the unsharpened end serves as a makeshift handle."
153,Blade of the East,none,12, 12, 45,"The Blade of the East has an effect of -2 hp for 10 seconds. It appears that the only cosmetic difference between The Blade of the East and a bumper sword is that it does not have a license plate on the underside of the sword. Legate Lanius can be seen hitting NCR (non-veteran) rangers with it, dismembering and getting one-hit kills. The weapon can also cause your enemies to fly backwards and be knocked out."
154,Blade of the West,none,12, 12, 5700,"A smaller, stronger variant of the bumper sword. It is slightly weaker than the Blade of the East, held by Lanius, though it has a higher DPS. It is cleaner in appearance than the bumper sword and Blade of the East, with a polished blade and without rope connecting the bumper and pipe."
155,Chainsaw,none,12, 20, 2800,"A fusion-powered chainsaw which requires two hands to use. The weapon is heavy, but deals considerable damage because its continuous cutting action allows it to bypass Damage Resistance and Damage Threshold. Unlike most melee weapons, holding down the attack button when wielding the chainsaw will cause continuous damage to targets in contact with the blade."
156,Cleaver,none,12, 2, 20,"The cleaver was designed to chop hunks of meat for use in butcher's shops, but has since been repurposed as a melee weapon. It also does bonus damage to limbs."
157,Chopper,none,12, 2, 800,"The Chopper is an aged and rusted version of a cleaver with white tape wrapped around the handle, and with the blade curved upward. Additionally, it deals more damage than a normal cleaver, including higher Critical Hit and limb damage."
158,Combat knife,none,12, 1, 500,"A large knife designed for both combat and survival purposes. It has a long, clip-point blade with serrations along the  back intended for cutting rope and small branches."
159,Chance's knife,none,12, 1, 900,"This knife belonged to Chance, one of the Great Khans and a prominent character in the graphic novel All Roads. The blade is still stained by the blood of the Fiends it last killed at the tribal village. With a Melee Weapons skill of 100 and all of the damage and attack speed boosting perks, its DPS becomes as prominent as Oh, Baby!, which is an outstanding feat, considering it has 5% of the weight (2.5% with Pack Rat). The only downside is that the lower DAM makes it more vulnerable to high-DT enemies, which is offset somewhat by poisons. Also, because of the fact that it is near Goodsprings, if the player can survive the nearby cazadores, this weapon can be had at a very early level."
160,Cosmic knife,none,12, 1, 35,"“The alloy that makes up the Pre-War kitchen knives is unknown, and seems to have decayed in contact with the toxic cloud.”— Loading screen"
161,Cosmic knife clean,none,12, 1, 50,"The cosmic knife clean is a melee weapon almost identical in appearance to the standard variant, except all the cloud residue has been cleaned off, revealing a smooth, shiny blade."
162,Cosmic knife super-heated,none,12, 1, 50,"The cosmic knife super-heated appears as an ordinary cosmic knife with an orange glow. It will set enemies on fire for a brief period when a critical hit is made. It also has a significantly higher critical multiplier than the other variants, as well as bonus limb damage."
163,Fire axe,none,12, 8, 2500,"The fire axe is a wooden handled axe with a heavy steel head intended for firefighting use. It has a broad finely sharpened front blade and a sharp pick point on the rear of the head. The long hardwood handle allows for sweeping attacks at reasonable distance and is partially rubber coated to ensure a good grip on the weapon. Originally designed for breaking down walls and doors, this weapon can inflict severe damage to a soft target. "
164,Knock-Knock,none,12, 8, 3200,"Knock-Knock is a cleaner, more powerful version of the fire axe, with a matte black handle and a polished steel head with a longer fluke."
165,Hatchet,none,12, 2, 75,"It is a hand-axe with a rubber-gripped wooden handle for chopping wood and limbs alike. Unlike throwing hatchets, these are not balanced for use as a projectile weapon. Hatchets deal an additional 50% Limb Damage."
166,Katana,none,12, 3, 2500,"The single-edged, razor-sharp blade is extremely effective against most enemies, because it has a high attack speed of over three hits per second."
167,Knife,none,12, 1, 20,"A simple chef's knife with low melee damage. Extremely common to the point of being cheap clutter. It is one of the required components in the crafting of the weapon binding ritual in the Honest Hearts add-on. Its availability and low cost makes it ideal for repairing higher-ended one-handed melee weapons with the Jury Rigging perk. It is also a (basic) holdout weapon, and so can be brought into areas where weapons are restricted regardless of the character's sneak skill."
168,Knife spear,none,12, 3, 55,The knife spear is a two-handed Melee weapon often carried by the ghost people of the Sierra Madre. It is constructed by duct-taping four cosmic knives to the end of a broom stick handle.
169,Knife spear clean,none,12, 3, 55,"The knife spear clean is a two-handed melee weapon. It is similar in appearance to the regular knife spear, but it does 5 more DAM, has a higher critical hit chance and causes bonus limb damage."
170,Machete,none,12, 2, 50,"The machete appears to be a makeshift weapon, and consists of a lawn mower blade strapped to a wooden handle. It is the primary melee weapon of Caesar's Legion. Aside from having a low Strength requirement, it also does bonus damage to limbs."
171,Broad machete,none,12, 1, 75,"The broad machete has a unique world model and an appearance that sets it apart from other machetes; the bolo-style blade is well-traveled and well-honed, making it a more conventional machete as opposed to the makeshift design used by the Legionaries. It also has a unique Pip-Boy icon when selected. The broad machete has considerably higher DPS (especially at higher levels), and a higher base damage as well. These factors make it an excellent weapon for melee-based characters, especially early on, where the broad machete tends to outperform other melee weapons by a considerable factor. Its forward power attack is more akin to non-player character power attacks, as well."
172,Liberator,none,12, 2, 1000,"Liberator is a unique machete that sports a higher damage per hit and triple the damage per second. Even though it is a unique weapon, it shares the same appearance as any other machete."
173,Machete gladius,none,12, 2, 1000,"The wide blade at the head with an indentation into the blade towards the hilt is designed to give more weight to the head of the blade, allowing for more momentum with slashes. Like a machete, it does bonus limb damage. It can be repaired with another machete gladius, or regular machetes. It has a fairly high DPS due to its speed, which allows up to 3.5 regular attacks per second; combined with its 28 base damage, it readily cuts through most armored enemies."
174,Proton axe,none,12, 8, 3500,"The proton axe resembles a futuristic war-axe with a glowing blue blade of electrical energy at its head. On the other side it has two capacitors which also share the same blue electric current. It does electrical damage with extra damage against robots and power armor users. It can be repaired with the inexpensive proton throwing axe, raising its resell value drastically."
175,Protonic inversal axe,none,12, 8, 4000,"The protonic inversal axe is a variant of the proton axe, having a dark blue-violet blade, whitish capacitors, and a black handle. Compared to the standard proton axe, it deals increased damage and much more critical damage, in addition to being much more durable. It is a very effective melee weapon against just about any enemy, especially robots or power armor users."
176,Ripper,none,12, 6, 1200,"This weapon is essentially a chainsaw compacted into knife form so that it can be wielded with just one hand. Nevertheless, the Ripper inherits many of the qualities of its larger version. The attack button can be held down and it will dismember anything in front of the player, much like a chainsaw or thermic lance, and its continuous cutting action means the Ripper ignores Damage Resistance and Damage Threshold. This makes it very good for handling multiple enemies or large, but slow, creatures."
177,Shishkebab,none,12, 3, 2500,"The Shishkebab is a flaming melee weapon which sets the target on fire upon impact. Although it appears to run on fuel from the tank on the player's back, it actually uses no fuel at all. Even though its blade is wreathed in fire, poisons can still be applied to the blade of the Shishkebab. The damage over time from the applied poison stacks with the immolation damage."
178,Gehenna,none,12, 3, 12000,"Gehenna is the GRA variant of the Shishkebab, a flaming melee weapon which sets the target on fire upon impact. It appears to run on fuel from the gas tank on the player's back, though its use in-game requires no fuel source."
179,Straight razor,none,12, 1, 35,"The straight razor is an old-fashioned shaving razor with a polished wooden handle. Though its blade is short, it's lightweight and can deliver several slashing hits in rapid succession. It also provides bonus Critical Chance benefits, and bonus Critical damage."
180,Figaro,none,12, 1, 400,"A unique variant of the straight razor, it features a slightly tarnished metal handle with a polished silver blade decorated with ornate etchings. It counts as a holdout weapon and therefore can be smuggled into casinos. The Figaro boasts superior damage and critical damage, attack speed and double the critical chance compared to the standard straight razor."
181,Switchblade,none,12, 1, 35,"It is a small knife whose blade is held in position with a spring. It has received a significant boost in damage compared to its counterpart in Fallout 3, but it is still one of the weaker melee weapons in the Mojave Wasteland. However, its small size makes it easily smuggled into restricted areas and makes for easy handling."
182,Thermic lance,none,12, 20, 5500,"The thermic lance is an industrial metalworking tool that heats and melts an iron tube packed with iron rods in the presence of pressurized oxygen, producing the high temperatures required for cutting through steel girders and other thick metal objects.[1] It is heavy, but deals considerable damage because its continuous penetrating action allows it to bypass the target's Damage Resistance and Damage Threshold. It is very durable, and also resists damage to itself if hit when used defensively (taking only 0.5% of normal durability damage). However, due to its automatic attack-type, it will degrade at a faster rate than other weapons when used."
183,9 iron,none,13, 3, 55,This old 9 iron is bent and battered after many years of exposure to the elements. 
184,Nephi's golf driver,none,13, 1, 500,"Nephi's golf driver is a unique golf club utilized as a two-handed weapon. Compared to its more common variant, the 9 iron, it is in more pristine condition and appears to be straight rather than old and battered. It has better critical damage but is more brittle than the standard golf club."
185,Baseball bat,none,13, 3, 250,"This melee weapon in Fallout: New Vegas is identical in appearance to the baseball bat seen in Fallout 3, but it deals more damage. "
186,Cattle prod,none,13, 3, 450,"Normally used for herding stubborn cattle, it has been re-purposed as a non-lethal weapon against humans. In addition to the taser-like prongs at the tip normally found on cattle prods, it has been outfitted with a thick, electrified metal coil around the striking end, hooked up to a pair of batteries taped down near the handle. "
187,Dress cane,none,13, 3, 40,"The dress cane is a melee weapon carried by the members of the White Glove Society. Like all things owned by the White Gloves, it is in excellent condition, and is made of a sturdy, shiny black wood with an ivory handle. It cannot be walked with and is always held as a weapon, even when walking slowly."
188,Lead pipe,none,13, 3, 75,"One of the ends has tape wrapped around it to improve grip, while the other is heavily corroded and/or bloodstained, and topped with a pipe fitting. Though it has a short reach, it has decent damage and a fast swing, making it an especially good melee weapon for players who are just starting out."
189,The Humble Cudgel,none,13, 3, 350,"The Humble Cudgel is a unique version of the lead pipe. It is less corroded, and has a T fitting on the end similar to a mallet. Its middle section is also slightly bent. The Humble Cudgel deals an extra 4 damage over its non-unique counterpart, and uses 3 less AP per attack when wielded in V.A.T.S. It also has 50% more item HP than the standard lead pipe. However, it has a somewhat shorter reach than a regular lead pipe; most likely a result of the kink in the main section of the pipe itself."
190,Nail board,none,13, 4, 250,"This 2x4 has several nails driven through it, with a whittled shaft to ensure a better grip. It looks identical to the version in Fallout 3, and is still used by super mutants."
191,Old Glory,none,13, 8, 2500,Old Glory is the signature weapon of Ulysses. It is a maple flag pole capped with a golden eagle. 
192,Pool cue,none,13, 1, 15,"The pool cue is a long, slim rod of polished wood decorated with colored stripes, used in cue sports. It has a long reach and does an average amount of damage."
193,Police baton,none,13, 2, 70,"A weapon meant to keep order, used by long-gone police. Now used by peacekeepers and trouble-makers alike."
194,Rebar club,none,13, 9, 500,"This crude weapon is a piece of concrete with three pieces of rebar sticking out of it. In addition, the bottom of the three rebars appears to be wound together with a strip of brown leather or cloth to make a handle. The club requires a Strength of 9 and a Melee Weapons skill of 50 for it to be at its maximum potential. "
195,Nuka Breaker,none,13, 8, 7800,"It is a Nuka-Cola sign, now re-purposed as a devastating melee weapon.

199,Super sledge,none,13, 20, 5800,"It is a heavy two-handed hammer, and contains a kinetic energy storage device to increase the knockback effect of the weapon. It is rather cumbersome and slow, but very powerful."
200,"Oh, Baby!",none,13, 20, 6200,"Oh, Baby! is a unique variant of the super sledge. It is much more powerful than the standard variant and has noticeably larger striking surfaces. Despite its rusted condition, it is one of the most powerful melee weapons in the game."
201,Tire iron,none,13, 3, 40,"A rusty old tire iron, normally used for loosening nuts from car tires. The tire iron has a high damage for a low-level weapon."
202,War club,none,13, 3, 75,"It is made of a hardwood native to the Zion Valley that has been sculpted into a 2-foot long club. The war club is the signature weapon of the Dead Horses tribe, hence the striking end of the weapon being shaped like a horse's head."
203,X-2 antenna,none,13, 15, 6000,"It is one of the many special antennas used to make the radar-guided repulsive field around the Big Mountain Research and Development Center, and for the transmissions of the X-2 array. When used as a weapon it focuses brainwave patterns and does electrical damage, causing extra damage to robots and power armor users."
204,Proton throwing axe,none,14, 1, 100,"It is similar in appearance to the proton axe, but is much smaller. It is a thrown weapon and it explodes on impact. These weapons are quite uncommon, so one should take careful aim when using one.
As an advantage towards robots, it can target a combat inhibitor in V.A.T.S. as if it's in full view, even if the robot is facing the player. Unlike the non throwing version, it does not have an EMP effect."
205,Protonic inversal throwing axe,none,14, 1, 200,"Like its larger counterpart, the protonic inversal throwing axe is a much more rare version of the standard proton throwing axe, being shortened and balanced for ranged combat. It does 20 more points of base damage than the normal proton throwing axe at the expense of being much rarer."
206,Throwing hatchet,none,14, 2, 20,"Throwing hatchets require a Strength of 1 and a Melee Weapons skill of 25 to be used effectively. Like their non-thrown counterparts, throwing hatchets inflict an additional 50% in Limb Damage and are one of the most damaging thrown weapons, with the exception of explosives. However, they are extremely heavy when compared to throwing spears and knives, and are also much less common."
207,Throwing knife,none,14, 0.5, 20,"Being the deadly weapon of choice for assassins, throwing knives are as silent as they are cunning. They are small, light weight, quick, and quiet. They are about seven inches in length and made of lightweight alloy with a handle wrapped in red ribbon."
208,Throwing knife spear,none,14, 0.65, 25,"The throwing knife spear is similar in shape and design to the knife spear, except it has only one cosmic knife aerodynamically tied to the end of it."
209,Throwing spear,none,14, 0.5, 25,"A primitive but effective weapon used by Caesar's Legion to take out opponents from a distance without having to rely on bullets.
