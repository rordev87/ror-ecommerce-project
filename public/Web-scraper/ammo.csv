1,Guns,.22LR round, 0.0076, 1,"The .22LR is a very low powered round, especially when compared to the more common 5.56mm, .308, .44 or .45 Auto cartridges that are also used in the post-War world. The .22LR was used as a commercial small game hunting round, but wasn't as common on the East Coast as the .32. It has a self-contained ""rimfire"" primer and thus cannot be broken down to gain small pistol primers, nor can it be crafted."
2,Guns,.308 round, 0.055, 4,"The .308 round is the same as the Fallout 3 version and is still used by the sniper rifle and now the hunting rifle. However, the world model for the round was changed from a metal ammunition box to a cardboard box."
3,Guns,.357 Magnum round, 0.035, 2,"The .357 Magnum round, a Magnum handgun cartridge manufactured by Big Chief, has a significant powder load making it a very powerful cartridge for a pistol round, and acceptable for use in carbine length lever-action rifles."
4,Guns,.44 Magnum round, 0.043, 3,"The .44 Magnum round is a high powered Magnum pistol cartridge derived from the .44 special pistol round. The round was originally developed for revolvers, but with its high velocity and heavy bullet, manufacturers quickly developed lever-action rifles and carbines chambered in .44 Magnum. Ancient as it is, .44 Magnum still delivers quite a punch and proves to be quite effective in the field."
5,Guns,.45 Auto, 0.065, 3,"The .45 Auto round is manufactured by Union Cartridge, and is a large caliber auto-pistol cartridge for pistols and some submachine guns. After the completion of Honest Hearts, the ammunition type will also begin appearing in the main game."
6,Guns,.45-70 Gov't, 0.065, 4,"A powerful, .45 caliber, late 19th century era black powder rifle round, .45-70 Gov't (Government) rounds are one of the rarer types of ammunition found in the Mojave Wasteland. However, especially at higher levels, they can be bought in decent quantities from some merchants."
7,Guns,.50 MG, 0.25, 6,"The .50 MG is a large caliber heavy machine gun and long-range anti-materiel rifle round. It is the largest, most expensive, and heaviest conventional Guns ammunition in the game. The only weapons using it are the anti-materiel rifle and the GRA anti-materiel rifle. It has a weight of 0.25 pounds per round in Hardcore mode, the same weight as a 25mm grenade."
8,Guns,5mm round, 0.017, 1,"The 5mm round is a small caliber high velocity rifle cartridge. It is commonly belt-fed, and is available in rather high quantities, something made necessary by the notably large ""magazine"" sizes on the weapons that use it. For example, the minigun loads 240 rounds at one time and fires an exceptional rate, requiring that the player carries a huge supply if they intend to rely on miniguns. As of patch 1.3.0.452, standard and surplus 5mm rounds have a -10 DT effect."
9,Guns,5.56mm round, 0.026, 2,"The 5.56mm round, a high-velocity small-caliber rifle cartridge, is a general-purpose round for all guns, spanning the entire game's arsenal, from the early varmint rifle to the light machine gun. 5.56mm is common, light, cheap, easy to make, and is considered one of two ""small rifle"" cartridges, the other being 5mm."
10,Guns,9mm round, 0.029, 1,"The 9mm is a medium caliber auto-pistol round, suitable for use in handguns and submachine guns. While significantly rarer in more northern places of the United States, the southern states of Nevada and Arizona do enjoy widespread use of 9mm chambered weapons, compared to the more powerful and popular but expensive 10mm round firearms."
11,Guns,10mm round, 0.033, 2,"A medium caliber, high velocity auto-pistol round manufactured before the Great War."
12,Guns,12.7mm round, 0.064, 3,"The Hauer Premium Show Stopper 12.7mm civic defense round is a consumer-grade pistol round of identical bullet diameter to the military-grade .50 caliber, but less powerful. While it shares the same bullet diameter, the cartridge case is much shorter, holding far less powder than the full-sized .50 machinegun cartridge, facilitating use in auto-loading pistols and submachine guns."
13,Guns,12 gauge shotgun shell, 0.075, 2,"The Purebore Buckslayer Sure Shot 12 gauge shotgun shell is a large bore shotshell available in various buckshot loads and slugs. A specialized beanbag shell also exists for pacifist players, as well as coin shot shells. The add-on Gun Runners' Arsenal introduces 5 new varieties: 4/0 buckshot, 4/0 buckshot magnum, flechette, pulse slugs and fire damage dealing dragon's breath shells."
14,Guns,20 gauge shotgun shell, 0.065, 1,"Masterson low recoil/max power 20 gauge shotgun shells are very similar to their larger, better known cousins, 12 gauge shotgun shells. Smaller in bore size, they have lighter powder loads and a smaller amount of shot, resulting in lower recoil and reduced target effect. 20 gauge shotshells consist of a plastic hull loaded with pistol powder and using multiple projectiles or a single slug."
15,Explosives,25mm grenade, 0.25, 8,"This is standard ammunition for the Grenade machinegun. All varieties explode on impact except the timed, which explodes about five seconds after launch, bouncing off things it hits earlier. They deal 50 damage in a radius of 8.59 yards (7.85 meters)."
16,Explosives,40mm grenade, 0.5, 12,"This is a projectile that is fired from 40mm grenade launchers. They are much bigger than 25mm grenades, making them heavier and harder to fire at great speed. They deal 100 damage in a radius of 11.72 yards (10.72 meters)."
17,Explosives,Missile, 1.5, 50,"Guided explosives used by the missile launcher. Due to an engine bug, all non-hitscan projectiles such as Missiles do no impact damage outside of VATS."
18,Explosives,Mini nuke, 3, 250,"Mini nukes are much less common in Fallout: New Vegas than in Fallout 3: there are only 14 in the base game (12 with the Wild Wasteland trait). They weigh 3 pounds each in Hardcore mode and are shaped like the WWII atomic bomb ""Fat Man."" Their explosion is powerful, causing a characteristic mushroom cloud and leaving residual radioactivity, initially 40 rads/sec., but which quickly drops to low levels that linger for quite a while. The Lonesome Road add-on introduces the possibility of mini nukes randomly spawning in duffle bags and other containers. Due to their rarity and effectiveness, mini nukes are the most valuable ammunition type in game."
19,Explosives,Rocket, 0.25, 25,"A self propelled projectile armed with a high explosive charge, these are used by the Divide's signature weapon, the Red Glare."
20,Energy Weapons,Alien power cell, 0.02, 10,"These are only obtainable if the Wild Wasteland trait is active (if Wild Wasteland is not active, hostile mercenaries with the YCS/186 unique Gauss rifle will be there instead). The alien captain will drop up to around 222 alien power cells along with the alien blaster."
21,Energy Weapons,Electron charge pack, 0.025, 1,"These small electron batteries are used as ammunition by several energy weapons. Unlike energy cells and microfusion cells, they are used to power rapid firing energy weapons, as well as Tesla weaponry. "
22,Energy Weapons,Energy cell, 0.078, 2,"Energy cells are small, self-contained energy storage units often associated with one-handed energy weapons and act essentially as a very powerful battery or capacitor. They are the standard ammunition used by the majority of pistol-sized energy weapons, and as such are widely available across the Mojave Wasteland."
23,Energy Weapons,Flamer fuel, 0.0200.025, 1,A mixture of petro-chemicals and other flammable compounds for use in specialty flamethrowers.
24,Energy Weapons,Microfusion cell, 0.1, 3,"The microfusion cell model No. 1040 MFC, a medium-sized energy production unit, is a self-contained fusion plant with an output of 1040.8 VDC used as ammunition for energy weapons. It is the primary energy source for rifle-type energy weapons, and is commonly available within the Mojave Wasteland. Microfusion cells are more powerful than energy cells, but are less capable of rapid discharge than electron charge packs. Microfusion cells can also be rigged into improvised grenade weapons."
25,Energy Weapons,Microfusion breeder, 0, 0,"A specially designed kind of energy cell that is unique in that it is not a physical object that can be gathered like other ammunition. Found only in Recharger weapons, these energy cells replenish their reserves over time, essentially providing infinite ammunition. Like other Energy weapon ammunition, it negates 2 points of Enemy DT. Unlike other power sources, however, it cannot be overcharged to deal extra damage."
